                    Around 6 years ago, I picked up photography as a hobbie. It's lovely going out and capturing places and things I like.

                    I never really had a 'style' or preference if I say so myself, although I do like capturing landscapes.

                    As with many starting photographers these days, I started out with digital. I have a DSLR and that's what I picked up first, but I've been shooting more and more with my phone lately.

                        <source srcset="../img/tb.avif" title="Torrebaja, 2022" width="100%">
                        <img src="" alt="">
                    </picture>
                    <div class="description">
                        <small>That's a photo of my town, 2022. 35mm film.</small>

                    Later, I discovered film and I'm enjoying how manual and slower it is and how thoughtful you have to be when deciding what deserves a photo and what not. Nowadays I only use it for special ocasions or trips. It's cool to see maybe half a year(or more!) of your life condensed into only 36 photos.

                    Alongside film, I started out with astrophotography as well and <u>I love it</u>!!! It is obviously made with my DSLR and I think you should try it! The entry barrier is lower than you might think.
