                    Since I was a kid I've always shown interest in music. My parents(and especially my aunts) have always played music around me and my siblings. It's because of them that I have continued to show interest on listening to new artists from all genres of music.

                <p>
                    2025 is the second year on a row that I'm accomplishing a self-imposed challenged: an annual playlist, where each week I listen to a never-before-heard album.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a way to force myself to listen to new artists and not get stuck on the usual ones. <br>
                    I don't know why I decided to start this, but I stick to it religiously. <br>
                    The cover for the playlist is the most memorable photo I took during that year.

                <h2>Favourite Artists</h2>
                <p>
                    Over the years I have changed on who my favourite artist was. From Coldplay to Aretha Franklin, to Daft Punk, VVV[Trippin' you] and El Petit de Cal Eril.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I try to listen a little bit of everything from all styles. This year, I have been listening <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A LOT</span> to <a href="http://">PinkPantheress</a>. I really don't know what kind of drug she puts into her songs but I'm addicted to it. I have no doubts she will be one of the most memorable artists of the 2020's.
                </p>

                                In 2021 I went to a Depresión Sonora concert and VVV were the opening act. I did not know nothing about them and I fell in love with their performance and their music. Even more than Depresión Sonora.  
                            </p>
                            <p>Since then, this band has been on my most listened artist on Spotify two years in a row! I love the depressive, angry and radical sound that they have going on.</p>
                            <p>I have many favourite tracks, but you should listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/track/2vlCD96gbODeKevuusi8Ic?si=97fe7343029745f3">Destrucción</a>.</p>

                                For the few of you who might not who Daft Punk are, they are an electronic dance music french duo. They made a big impact in house music, electronic music during the 90's and 00's and their music is simply sublime. 
                            </p>
                            <p>They have 4 absurdly good albums, although if you ask me about my favourite of them it would be <a href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/album/2noRn2Aes5aoNVsU6iWThc?si=utXpELQ4S5WqwInm3pp5oQ">Discovery</a>. I have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/album/4m2880jivSbbyEGAKfITCa?si=hkHBFUWrQ6S8p65xoEtarw">Random Access Memories</a> on vinyl, and it's definitely an experience. <br></p>

                            <p>

                                Honestly you should just go and listen to them, you'll thank me afterwards.
